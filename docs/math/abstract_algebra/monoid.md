## Magma

Magma is a set equipped with a binary operation that is closed:

$$
 a,b \in S \implies a \cdot b \in S.
$$

## Semigroup

Magma that is _associative_:
$$
 \forall a, b. c \in S \implies (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)
$$

is called a semigroup.

## Monoid

Semigroup with _identity_ $e$:
$$
 \exists e \in S \text{ such that }  \forall a \in S: e \cdot a = a = a \cdot e
$$
is called a monoid.

## Group

Monoid where every element has an _inverse_:
$$
  \forall a \in S \; \exists \; b \text{ such that } a \cdot b = e \text{, where }e\text{ is the identity element}
$$
 is called a group.
